# PHASE 1: HOMEPAGE BUILD

**CRITICAL:** Apply the £25,000 bespoke agency standard from rules.md. No template aesthetics. Hero must break convention. Services must not be a predictable grid. Every section must feel editorially designed.

## REQUIRED FILES

Create these files using the design system from rules.md:

1. `/css/variables.css` — Design tokens with client colours from [C04] and [C05]
2. `/css/styles.css` — Complete stylesheet per rules.md specifications
3. `/js/main.js` — Mobile nav, scroll reveal, form validation
4. `index.html` — Homepage

## HOMEPAGE SECTIONS + PLACEHOLDER MAPPING

Build index.html with these sections in order:

### 1. Header/Navigation
- Logo: [C93]
- Nav links: Home, About, Services, Contact

### 2. Hero
**MUST break convention. Consider:** split compositions, overlapping elements, asymmetric layout, dramatic scale contrast, unconventional image cropping. NOT a generic centred hero with button.

- Headline: [C06]
- Subheadline: [C07]
- Primary CTA: text [C08], url [C09]
- Secondary CTA: text [C10], url [C11]
- Hero image: [C89], alt [C90]

### 3. Services Preview
**NOT a symmetrical 3-column grid or icon-in-circle blocks.** Use editorial layout with visual hierarchy, varied card sizes, or asymmetric arrangement.

- Service 1: title [C12], description [C13], icon [C14]
- Service 2: title [C16], description [C17], icon [C18]
- Service 3: title [C20], description [C21], icon [C22]
- Service 4 (if populated): title [C24], description [C25], icon [C26]

### 4. About Preview
- Short about text: [C36]
- About image: [C91], alt [C92]

### 5. USPs
- USP 1: [C67]
- USP 2: [C68]
- USP 3: [C69]

### 6. Testimonials
- Quote 1: [C41], name [C42], role [C43]
- Quote 2: [C45], name [C46], role [C47]
- Quote 3 (if populated): [C49], name [C50], role [C51]

### 7. CTA Section
- Headline: [C70]
- Button: text [C08], url [C09]

### 8. Footer
- Follow exact LaunchedIn10 footer architecture from rules.md
- Logo: [C93] or [C94]
- Tagline: [C02]
- Contact: [C53], [C54], [C55-C59]
- Socials: [C61-C66] (only if populated)
