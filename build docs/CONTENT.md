## ABOUT

```
[C36] About — Short (50 words, for homepage):
I've been making films for fourteen years. From ski fields to factory floors, from research labs to rally stages — every project teaches me something new about how people work, what they care about, and why their stories matter. Based in Dunedin, working across Aotearoa.

[C37] About — Long (150-200 words, for about page):
I'm a Dunedin-based filmmaker helping New Zealand businesses tell stronger stories.

I work across the South Island and beyond — from heavy industry and construction to science, technology, councils, and adventure tourism. If you've got people doing interesting work, I want to help you show it.

I didn't set out to be a filmmaker. I came to New Zealand in 2004 from the north of England, chasing snow and adventure. Ended up as a ski instructor in Wanaka, then started playing with cameras, making little edits of mates snowboarding. Those edits turned into paid gigs. The paid gigs turned into a business.

After a decade building Flashworks Media — a B-Corp certified video production company — I wanted something different. Less managing, more making. Less chasing scale, more focusing on craft. So I shifted my life to Dunedin, simplified the business, and got back to what I love: working directly with clients, shooting beautiful footage, and telling stories that matter.

[C38] Mission Statement (optional):
Make the world a better place through stories. Always do the best work possible. Don't be a dick.

[C39] Year Established: 2011

[C40] Team Size (optional): Solo filmmaker with trusted network of collaborators

## PAGE CONTENT (Extended)

### Services Page — Full Descriptions

**Brand & Corporate Storytelling**
Your brand is more than a logo. It's the people who built it, the problems you solve, the values that drive your decisions. Brand films make that visible — showing customers, partners, and future employees who you really are.

Includes: Origin and founder stories, Company culture and values films, Stakeholder and investor content, Long-form documentary-style brand pieces, Customer and partner testimonials.

**Recruitment & Onboarding Videos**
The best recruitment content doesn't oversell. It shows the reality of working with you — the challenges, the culture, the people — so candidates can self-select. That means better applicants and better retention.

Includes: Day-in-the-life films, Role and team profiles, Safety culture and training content, Onboarding and induction videos, Staff interview series.

**Tech, Science & Research Communication**
Technical work deserves to be understood. Whether you're explaining a research breakthrough, demonstrating a new technology, or communicating scientific findings to non-expert audiences — video makes the complex accessible.

Includes: Research communication and dissemination, Technology explainers and demonstrations, Innovation and R&D stories, Conference and presentation content, Stakeholder and funder updates.

**Aerial, Drone & Timelapse**
Some stories need scale. Aerial footage reveals context, shows progress, and creates visual impact that ground-level shooting simply can't match.

Includes: Cinematic aerial filming (4K+), Construction progress documentation, Event and venue coverage, Landscape and destination content, Long-duration timelapse capture.

Technical: CAA Part 101 certified since 2013, Full compliance with all NZ aviation regulations, Experienced in sensitive environments, Professional-grade equipment with redundancy systems.

**Campaign & Commercial Content**
Sometimes you need content designed to make people do something specific: click, buy, sign up, attend, donate. Campaign content is strategic — every second earns its place.

Includes: Television commercials, Social media campaigns, Product launch content, Public awareness campaigns, Event promotion.

## PROCESS (How I Work)

```
Step 1: Discovery — We talk. I ask lots of questions. I want to understand your world, your audience, your goals, and your constraints.

Step 2: Proposal — I send a clear proposal: creative approach, scope, timeline, and cost. No surprises.

Step 3: Pre-production — We nail down the details: locations, interviewees, shot lists, schedules, logistics.

Step 4: Production — Shoot day(s). I arrive prepared, work efficiently, and capture what we need.

Step 5: Post-production — Edit, review, refine. You'll see rough cuts before anything is finalised.

Step 6: Delivery — Final files in all required formats, ready for whatever platforms you're using.
