## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Design
1. **Dark-first approach** — This client's brand is cinematic. Build with #0F172A as default background.
2. **Video facade pattern essential** — Client has multiple video embeds; performance will suffer without lazy loading.
3. **Case study pages** — Create individual pages for major projects, not just a grid. Each project deserves a proper showcase.

### Content
1. **Showreel is strong** — Feature prominently on homepage. Consider muted background video or prominent embed.
2. **Testimonials are excellent** — Use Hayden Paddon quote as hero social proof (recognisable name in NZ).
3. **Blog content is ready** — Three substantial posts can launch with site. Good for immediate SEO value.

### Technical
1. **Calendly integration critical** — Every CTA leads to "Book a Free Call". Without this, conversion path breaks.
2. **YouTube nocookie mode** — Use privacy-enhanced embeds for all YouTube videos.
3. **Preconnect to video hosts** — Add link preconnects for Vimeo and YouTube in head.

### SEO
1. **Local focus** — "Video production Dunedin" and "filmmaker Dunedin" are primary targets.
2. **Case studies help ranking** — Individual pages for each project create more rankable content.
3. **VideoObject schema** — Apply to all case study pages for rich results.

### Post-Launch
1. **Google Business Profile** — Client should set up GBP for local search visibility.
2. **Request reviews** — Encourage existing clients to leave Google reviews.
3. **Add more case studies** — Site structure supports easy addition of new projects.
