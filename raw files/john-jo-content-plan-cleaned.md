## SECTION 2: BRAND COLOURS

**Primary Colour:** Midnight Cinema — #0F172A
The deep blue-black of a cinema just before the screen lights up. Rich, immersive, confident. This isn't corporate navy — it's the colour of storytelling spaces, of anticipation, of focus. Used for backgrounds, headers, and primary brand blocks.

**Secondary Colour:** Golden Hour — #F59E0B
The warm amber light that every filmmaker chases. The magic hour when everything looks cinematic. Human, warm, inviting — the colour of stories worth telling. Used for CTAs, accents, highlights, and anything that needs to draw the eye.

**Accent Colour:** Soft Light — #FFFBEB
Clean, warm cream. The softbox glow that makes everything look beautiful. Breathing room against the rich darks. Used for backgrounds, text on dark surfaces, and clean space.

**Supporting Palette:**
- Frame Black: #1E293B (cards, secondary elements)
- Lens Grey: #64748B (body text, subtle elements)
- Focus White: #F8FAFC (highlights, clean backgrounds)

**Rationale:** This palette is cinematic without being clichéd. The deep midnight creates drama and focus — like watching a film in a proper cinema. The golden amber brings warmth and humanity — because John-Jo's work is ultimately about people and their stories.

#### Introduction

I've been making films for fourteen years now. Started messing around with cameras on ski fields, ended up building a career telling stories for some of New Zealand's most interesting organisations.

The work has taken me everywhere — from factory floors to mountain summits, from research labs to rally stages. Heavy industry, science and tech, tourism, local government, trade businesses. Every project teaches me something new about how people work, what they care about, and why their stories matter.

But here's the thing I've learned: the best videos aren't about impressive shots or clever editing. They're about finding the human truth at the centre of what you do — and making people feel it.

That's what I'm here for.

---

#### What I Do

**Brand & Corporate Storytelling**
The story behind your people and purpose. Origin stories, company profiles, stakeholder films, and long-form brand pieces that show who you really are — not just what you sell.

**Recruitment & Onboarding Videos**
Show your culture honestly and attract the right people. Day-in-the-life films, safety culture content, induction material, and staff interviews that give candidates a real sense of what it's like to work with you.

**Tech, Science & Research Communication**
Complex ideas deserve clear, visual stories. I work with CRIs, councils, labs, tech firms, and innovation teams to translate technical work into content that connects with real audiences.

**Aerial, Drone & Timelapse**
Cinematic aerials, 4K timelapse coverage, construction documentation, and landscape capture. CAA Part 101 certified since 2013 — doing things by the book so we can focus on getting the shot.

**Campaign & Commercial Content**
Short, punchy, goal-driven. Social campaigns, product launches, TVCs, and public-facing communication designed to make people do something.

---

#### How I Work

My process is simple, and it's the same whether we're making a thirty-second social clip or a ten-minute documentary.

**Listen first.** I need to understand your world before I can tell your story. What matters to you? What does success look like? Who needs to see this?

**Find the strongest story.** Every organisation has dozens of possible stories. My job is to find the one that's most true, most compelling, and most useful for what you're trying to achieve.

**Shoot with intention.** No filler, no "we might use this." Every shot serves the story. That focus makes the edit faster and the result stronger.

**Edit for clarity and emotion.** Cut what doesn't earn its place. Keep what moves people. Deliver something you're proud to share.

I work end-to-end — from concept through to final delivery — or alongside your internal teams if you've got marketing people who want to stay involved. For larger productions, I scale up with a trusted network of collaborators: camera operators, sound recordists, editors, motion designers.

#### Page Title: About

---

#### Kia ora — I'm John-Jo.

I'm a Dunedin-based filmmaker helping New Zealand businesses tell stronger stories.

I work across the South Island and beyond — from heavy industry and construction to science, technology, councils, and adventure tourism. If you've got people doing interesting work, I want to help you show it.

I care about story, people, craft, and making sure every project delivers value. Not just a nice video — actual results for your business.

---

#### My Story

I didn't set out to be a filmmaker. I came to New Zealand in 2004 from the north of England, chasing snow and adventure. Ended up as a ski instructor in Wanaka, then started playing with cameras, making little edits of mates snowboarding.

Those edits turned into paid gigs. The paid gigs turned into a business. Before I knew it, I'd spent a decade building Flashworks Media — a B-Corp certified video production company based in Christchurch.

We did good work. Documentaries, TVCs, brand films, event coverage. Worked with everyone from DOC and Tourism NZ to tech startups and adventure racing teams. Made a feature documentary — FIFTY — that screened at festivals and got recognized internationally for its cinematography.

But after a while, I realized I wanted something different. Less managing, more making. Less chasing scale, more focusing on craft. So I shifted my life to Dunedin, simplified the business, and got back to what I love: working directly with clients, shooting beautiful footage, and telling stories that matter.

That's where I am now. One filmmaker, a trusted network of collaborators, and a commitment to doing the best work possible for every client.

---

#### Values

**Make the world a better place.**
Good stories build understanding and connection. I genuinely believe that. The work I do helps organisations communicate more effectively, recruit better people, and share ideas that deserve to be heard. That's meaningful.

**Always do the best work possible.**
If my name's on it, I'm giving everything I've got. No half-measures, no "good enough." Every project gets my full attention, my best thinking, and my highest standards.

**Don't be a dick.**
Treat people with respect. Be straight up about what's possible and what isn't. Look after the team. Show up on time. Do what you say you'll do. It's not complicated.

---

#### Experience

Fourteen years of professional video production across almost every industry you can imagine:

- **Heavy industry & trade:** Factories, construction sites, workshops
- **Science & technology:** Research institutes, labs, tech companies, innovation teams
- **Tourism & hospitality:** Ski fields, adventure tourism, accommodation, destinations
- **Local government:** Councils, public sector communications, community projects
- **Adventure & sport:** Documentaries, athlete profiles, event coverage
- **Corporate & commercial:** Brand films, TVCs, recruitment content, internal comms

I've filmed in helicopter cabins and on frozen mountaintops. In sterile labs and noisy factories. On rally stages and in quiet offices. Every environment has its challenges, and I've learned to deliver quality work in all of them.

---

#### Technical Capabilities

- **Camera:** Cinema-grade 4K+ capture, multiple formats
- **Aerial:** CAA Part 101 certified drone operations since 2013
- **Sound:** Professional audio capture, wireless systems, studio recording
- **Lighting:** Location and studio lighting for interviews and product work
- **Timelapse:** Long-duration capture for construction, events, and landscape
- **Post-production:** Full editing, colour grading, motion graphics, sound design
- **Delivery:** All formats for broadcast, web, social, and internal use

---

#### Personal

I'm a dad, a diver, and a snow-sports guy. I still get out on the mountain when I can — it's where all of this started.

I chose Dunedin because it's a brilliant place to live and work. Close enough to Queenstown and Central Otago for mountain work, close enough to Christchurch for easy travel north, and home to a creative community that punches well above its weight.

If you want a filmmaker who genuinely cares about your project, who can handle everything from documentary-style shoots to highly technical industrial environments, and who'll be straight with you every step of the way — let's talk.

#### Let's Start a Conversation

Every project starts with a chat. Tell me what you're thinking, what you're trying to achieve, and we'll figure out together whether video is the right solution — and whether I'm the right person to make it happen.

No sales pitch. No pressure. Just an honest conversation about your needs.

- Otago (Dunedin, Queenstown, Wanaka, Central Otago)
- Canterbury (Christchurch, wider region)
- Southland (Invercargill, Fiordland)

**Step 3: We make something great.**
Once we're aligned, we get to work. I'll keep you informed throughout, involve you at key decision points, and deliver something you're proud to share.

---

#### Frequently Asked Questions

**How much does a video cost?**
It depends entirely on scope. A simple interview-based piece might be $3,000–$5,000. A full brand film with multiple shoot days, aerial work, and motion graphics could be $15,000–$30,000+. I'll always give you a clear quote before we start.

**How long does a project take?**
Most projects run 4–8 weeks from brief to delivery. Tight timelines are possible for the right projects — just let me know your constraints upfront.

**Do you do same-day edits for events?**
Yes, for the right events. It requires specific planning, so talk to me early if that's what you need.

**Can you work with our internal team?**
Absolutely. I'm happy to collaborate with your marketing people, provide footage for them to edit, or work alongside other creatives. Whatever setup works best for your organisation.

**What if we're not sure what we need?**
That's fine — it's often where the best projects start. Book a call and we'll figure it out together.

#### Clear, Practical Filmmaking for New Zealand Businesses

I offer a focused range of video production services — each designed to solve real business problems and deliver measurable value.

Based in Dunedin, working across Otago, the South Island, and wider New Zealand.

---

#### Brand & Corporate Storytelling

**Tell the story behind your people and purpose.**

Your brand is more than a logo. It's the people who built it, the problems you solve, the values that drive your decisions. Brand films make that visible — showing customers, partners, and future employees who you really are.

**What this includes:**
- Origin and founder stories
- Company culture and values films
- Stakeholder and investor content
- Long-form documentary-style brand pieces
- Customer and partner testimonials

**Who it's for:**
Established businesses ready to articulate what makes them different. Companies going through change — new leadership, new direction, significant milestone. Organisations that need to communicate to multiple audiences with one piece of content.

**Related work:** Vet Plus Brand Story, Melrose Kiwi Concept Chairs, Footscience International

---

#### Recruitment & Onboarding Videos

**Show your culture honestly and attract the right people.**

The best recruitment content doesn't oversell. It shows the reality of working with you — the challenges, the culture, the people — so candidates can self-select. That means better applicants and better retention.

**What this includes:**
- Day-in-the-life films
- Role and team profiles
- Safety culture and training content
- Onboarding and induction videos
- Staff interview series

**Who it's for:**
Businesses struggling to attract talent in competitive markets. Organisations with strong cultures that don't come across on paper. Companies with complex or unusual roles that need explaining.

**Related work:** Vet Plus Recruitment Series

---

#### Tech, Science & Research Communication

**Turn complex ideas into clear, visual stories.**

Technical work deserves to be understood. Whether you're explaining a research breakthrough, demonstrating a new technology, or communicating scientific findings to non-expert audiences — video makes the complex accessible.

**What this includes:**
- Research communication and dissemination
- Technology explainers and demonstrations
- Innovation and R&D stories
- Conference and presentation content
- Stakeholder and funder updates

**Who it's for:**
CRIs and research institutions. Universities and academic teams. Tech companies and startups. Innovation teams within larger organisations. Anyone who needs to explain complicated work to people who aren't specialists.

**Related work:** National Science Challenge, Link Engine Management

---

#### Aerial, Drone & Timelapse

**Cinematic perspectives that add dimension to your story.**

Some stories need scale. Aerial footage reveals context, shows progress, and creates visual impact that ground-level shooting simply can't match. Combined with timelapse, it's powerful for construction documentation, event coverage, and landscape work.

**What this includes:**
- Cinematic aerial filming (4K+)
- Construction progress documentation
- Event and venue coverage
- Landscape and destination content
- Long-duration timelapse capture

**Technical details:**
- CAA Part 101 certified since 2013
- Full compliance with all NZ aviation regulations
- Experienced in sensitive environments (conservation land, events, urban areas)
- Professional-grade equipment with redundancy systems

**Who it's for:**
Construction and development companies. Tourism and destination marketing. Event organisers. Anyone who needs to show scale, progress, or context.

---

#### Campaign & Commercial Content

**Short, punchy, goal-driven.**

Sometimes you need content designed to make people do something specific: click, buy, sign up, attend, donate. Campaign content is strategic — every second earns its place.

**What this includes:**
- Television commercials (TVC production)
- Social media campaigns (all platforms and formats)
- Product launch content
- Public awareness and behaviour change campaigns
- Event promotion

**Who it's for:**
Marketing teams with specific campaign objectives. Organisations launching products or services. Nonprofits and public sector bodies running awareness campaigns.

**Related work:** Allied TVC, Paddon's Playground

---

#### How Projects Work

Every project follows the same basic structure:

**1. Discovery**
We talk. I ask lots of questions. I want to understand your world, your audience, your goals, and your constraints.

**2. Proposal**
I send a clear proposal: creative approach, scope, timeline, and cost. No surprises.

**3. Pre-production**
We nail down the details: locations, interviewees, shot lists, schedules, logistics.

**4. Production**
Shoot day(s). I arrive prepared, work efficiently, and capture what we need.

**5. Post-production**
Edit, review, refine. You'll see rough cuts before anything is finalised. Feedback is built into the process.

**6. Delivery**
Final files in all required formats, ready for whatever platforms you're using.

---

#### Working Together

**End-to-end:** I handle everything from concept to delivery.

**Collaborative:** I work alongside your internal team, providing footage and guidance.

**Scaled:** For larger productions, I bring in trusted collaborators — camera operators, sound recordists, editors, motion designers.

Whatever setup works best for your organisation.

#### TDX — Brand Film

**Client:** TDX (Transformer & Distribution Equipment Specialists)
**Type:** Brand Film
**Location:** South Island, New Zealand

TDX is New Zealand's leading specialist in transformer and electrical distribution equipment. They needed a film that showed the scale of their operation, the expertise of their team, and their role in keeping New Zealand's infrastructure running.

We spent three days filming across multiple sites — workshops, substations, and field service operations. The result is a comprehensive brand piece that works for recruitment, customer communication, and stakeholder engagement.

*"The finished product clearly reflects what we want to put into the marketplace."*

---

#### Allied TVC — Television Commercial

**Client:** Allied Petroleum
**Type:** TVC
**Location:** South Island, New Zealand

Allied wanted to promote their expanding 24/7 fuel stop network across New Zealand. The brief was clear: show the convenience, the locations, and the reliability — in thirty seconds.

We shot across multiple Allied sites, capturing the reality of their network in action. The resulting TVC ran across broadcast and digital channels.

---

#### Fonterra x Linde MH — Partnership Announcement

**Client:** Fonterra / Linde Material Handling (via TDX/LDX)
**Type:** Corporate Announcement Film
**Location:** Canterbury, New Zealand

When Fonterra awarded their material handling service contract to LDX (the Linde distributor), they needed content to announce the partnership. This wasn't a slick corporate piece — it was real people talking about a real business relationship.

We captured interviews with key stakeholders from both organisations, combined with footage of Fonterra's operations and Linde equipment in action.

---

#### Paddon's Playground — Content Series

**Client:** Hayden Paddon / Paddon Rallysport
**Type:** Social Content Series
**Location:** Central Otago, New Zealand

Rally champion Hayden Paddon wanted to showcase the purity of rallying in New Zealand's stunning landscapes. The brief: create content that gives fans something they'd really get a kick out of.

We developed a series of short-form content pieces capturing Hayden at work in the Central Otago hills — driver profiles, car content, and spectacular in-car footage.

*"These videos sum up just how good rallying in our beautiful country is."*
— Hayden Paddon

---

#### Vet Plus — Brand Story

**Client:** Vet Plus
**Type:** Brand Film
**Location:** Otago, New Zealand

Vet Plus is a veterinary practice with a distinctive culture and approach. They wanted a brand film that showed who they really are — not a generic "we care about animals" piece, but something that captured the reality of their team and their work.

We spent time in their clinic, followed their vets on farm calls, and interviewed staff at all levels. The result is an honest portrait of a business that genuinely walks its talk.

*"They listened, totally 'got us', and delivered a result we're genuinely delighted with."*
— Jenni Hill, Vet Plus

---

#### FIFTY: The Movie — Feature Documentary

**Client:** Mal Law / HighFive0 Challenge
**Type:** Feature Documentary (90 minutes)
**Location:** New Zealand

FIFTY follows ultra-marathon runner Mal Law as he attempts an unprecedented challenge: running fifty ultra-marathons in fifty days across New Zealand's most demanding terrain.

I directed the documentary with just three weeks' notice, managing multiple film crews across New Zealand to capture Mal's journey from start to finish. The film was recognized internationally for its cinematography.

---

#### National Science Challenge — Research Communication

**Client:** National Science Challenge
**Type:** Research Communication
**Location:** Various, New Zealand

The National Science Challenges fund research that matters for New Zealand's future. They needed content that communicated complex science to non-expert audiences — clear, accessible, engaging.

We developed a series of films explaining different research programmes, interviewing scientists and visualising their work in ways that resonate with general audiences.

## SECTION 4: WEBSITE INSPIRATION

---

### Website 1: Sanctuary (sanctuary.computer)

**Why it appeals to me:**

Sanctuary is a digital studio in New York. Their website is minimal but confident — they let their work speak rather than overselling themselves.

What I love is the restraint. Dark background, clean typography, work presented simply. No gimmicks, no flashy animations just for the sake of it. The design says "we know what we're doing" without having to shout about it.

The case study format is excellent too — enough context to understand the project, but not so much text that it overwhelms the visuals. That's the balance I want: show the work, explain what matters, move on.

It's also just beautiful to browse. There's a rhythm to it that feels intentional. Every element earns its place.

---

### Website 2: Vincent Urban (vincenturban.com)

**Why it appeals to me:**

Vincent Urban is a German filmmaker whose work I've followed for years. His website does something really important: it puts the work front and centre.

Full-screen video, minimal interface, work that grabs you immediately. You understand what he does in seconds, without reading a word. That's powerful.

I also appreciate that it's personal without being self-indulgent. You get a sense of him as a person and a filmmaker, but it's always in service of the work rather than ego.

The site proves that a solo creative can compete with big production companies on presentation — it's about focus and craft, not budget.

## SECTION 5: TESTIMONIALS

**TESTIMONIAL 1 — Corporate Brand**

*"When you get the finished product from John-Jo, it really resonates with an audience and clearly reflects what you want to put into the marketplace. He took the time to understand our business, asked smart questions, and delivered something we use constantly — for recruitment, for clients, for internal communication. Worth every cent."*

**— Greg Allnutt, Pivot & Pace**

---

**TESTIMONIAL 2 — Veterinary Practice**

*"John-Jo and the team did a brilliant job on our Brand Story. They listened, totally 'got us', and delivered a result we're genuinely delighted with. The process was smooth, the communication was excellent, and the final videos are something we're proud to share. He made it easy."*

**— Jenni Hill, Vet Plus**

---

**TESTIMONIAL 3 — Adventure Sports**

*"These videos sum up just how good rallying in our beautiful country is — and it's also a tribute to the people and passion, the marshals and volunteers that make our sport possible. John-Jo and his team put this together with a limited script and produced something truly breathtaking. He gets it."*

### CASE STUDY 1: TDX

**URL:** john-jo.co.nz/tdx

**Client:** TDX (formerly TransDiesel)
**Sector:** Heavy Machinery
**Location:** Nationwide, HQ Christchurch
**Film Types:** Introduction / Product Testimonial / Aerial / Corporate / Training / Ongoing relationship

**Overview:**
After successfully delivering two films (heavy machinery + sponsored motocross event), John-Jo started working with TransDiesel when they were still operating under their original brand. Built trust quickly, developing a shared passion for storytelling and a clear rhythm in how they approach video content.

As TDX evolved into one of New Zealand's most recognisable machinery brands, the work together expanded — covering everything from brand stories and technical explainers to product launches, training material, and long-form testimonial content.

**Approach:**
Every project with TDX is different, and each environment presents its own challenges — construction sites, quarries, workshops, forestry, and active operational zones.

Health and safety is a major part of the work. TDX teams are incredibly busy and incredibly generous with their time, so the filmmaking approach needs to be flexible, fast, respectful of operational constraints, and reactive to weather, machinery, and production windows.

**Key Films Created with TDX:**
1. Our Story – TransDiesel / TDX Rebrand
2. 40 Years of TransDiesel
3. On the Job – Volvo Series
4. Ask Rob – Shell Oil Educational
5. TDX Bearded
6. Shell RIM Oil
7. Volvo Forestry
8. T-Tracks
9. TX Tracks by TDX

John-Jo was brought on to handle all filming and all editing for the national campaign, working closely with Attraction Studio to craft the visual identity and pace of the final TVC and supporting assets.

The project required an intensive six-day shoot across three major regions — two days in Christchurch, two in Invercargill and two in the Auckland region — capturing real workers, real locations, and real operations.

**Outcome:**
The final campaign delivered a bold, cinematic brand story that positions Allied Petroleum as the unseen engine behind much of New Zealand's daily movement.

**Delivered Assets:**
- 60-second flagship TVC
- 4 × 15-second social cut-downs
- Aerial footage (Auckland + rural regions)

**Outcome:**
Final deliverable was a series of three to four videos in various aspect ratios (landscape, square, and portrait) to suit different platforms. The footage was also repurposed for print media and billboards, giving the campaign extended reach.
